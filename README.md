# DSFiware-hackathon
This repository contains a generic version of the Data Space infrastructure deployed at the [Decarbomile Hack](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7266146265141301249/) that took place on _November 26-27 2024_ at the `ETSI Telecomunicaci√≥n UPM Madrid`. The HOL was lead by [ITA](https://www.ita.es/) & [Capillar](https://capillarit.com) with the collaboration of the [UPM](https://www.upm.es) and [Fiware](https://www.fiware.org) under the umbrella of the [Decarbomile-Revolutionising last mile logistics in Europe](https://decarbomile.eu/).  
The content of this github can be used to deploy a generic data space using the [Fiware Data Space Components](https://github.com/FIWARE/data-space-connector) and hence, aligned with the [DSBA Technical Convergence recommendations](https://data-spaces-business-alliance.eu/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/Data-Spaces-Business-Alliance-Technical-Convergence-V2.pdf) every organization participating in a data space should deploy.  
Once finalized the `Initial setup of the Dataspace`, you will be familiar with concepts related with:
-  The `deployment of infrastructures` (_Kubernetes and Helm commands_)
-  The `decentralized identity` (_DID, VC, VP, ..._) that any participant in a data space infrastructure must be familiar with.
- How `the access to the services` is achieved. 

From there, this github can be used as a playground to play with the policies ODRL deployed, replace the provider's service by your own service, ...

There are two methods to deploy the infrastructure:
- A [step by step guide](#step-by-step-deployment-guide) explaining the concepts introduced at every step and the commands to be run.
- A [quick deployment guide](#quick-eployment-from-scratch) with the same target, but focusing just on the commands.

**NOTE**: All commands run on these guidelines are executed from the github root folder.

## Step by step deployment guide


### [_Installation of the devop tools to ease the life during deployment_](./assets/docs/README-preparationGuide.md)
This section installs a set of tools used during the deployment of the components.  
See the [Preparation guide](./assets/docs/README-preparationGuide.md)

### [Deployment of apisix as proxy](./assets/docs/README-apisix.md)
This section describes the steps to test the kubernetes environment while deploying the Apisix Gateway.  
See the [apisix deployment guide](./assets/docs/README-apisix.md)

### [Deployment of the Verifiable Data Registry components (Trust-Anchor)](./assets/docs/README-trustAnchor.md)
This section describes the setup to deploy the components of the Verifiable Data Registry.  
See the [trust-anchor deployment guide](./assets/docs/README-trustAnchor.md)

### [Consumer's infrastructure](./assets/docs/README-consumer.md)
Any participant willing to consume services provided by the data space will require a minimum infrastructure that will enable the management of Verifiable Credentials besides a Decentralized Identifier that will constitue the signing mechanism to authenticate any message, any request made by the consumer.   
This section describes the steps and the components to be deployed.  
See the [consumer deployment guide](./assets/docs/README-consumer.md)

### [Provider's infrastructure](./assets/docs/README-provider.md)
Any organization willing to market their data and or services in a dataspace will require an infrastructure to manage:
- The authentication phase: Analyze that any request made to their services are made by a known and verified participant.
- The authorization phase: Analyze that any request made to their services are made by a participant entitled to perform the requested action.
- The data and or services offered.  
This section describes the steps and the components to be deployed at the provider's side
See the [consumer deployment guide](./assets/docs/README-provider.md)

### [Initial setup of the Dataspace](README-initialSetUpOfTheDS.md) 
This phase will show the actions to register the participants in the dataspace and will continue the configuration to provide authentication and authorization mechanisms to the dataspace to comply with the  [DSBA Technical Convergence recommendations](https://data-spaces-business-alliance.eu/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/Data-Spaces-Business-Alliance-Technical-Convergence-V2.pdf)

## Quick deployment from scratch
To speed up the deployment, this github contains two script files to perform the following actions (**NOTE**: although they are script files, they may contain steps that require manual actions (such as editting a file), so it is better to run them in chunks (copying, pasting) for a better understanding of the whole process):
- [On a Ubuntu machine Install a Microk8s kubernetes cluster](./scripts/installMicrok8s.rc)
```shell
. scripts/installMicrok8s.sh
# Nevertheless, there are steps that have to be performed manually like editting some files. 
# Hence, it is better to open the script and follow the instructions
```

- [Run the commands to deploy the Fiware DS components](./scripts/DSFiwareHackathon-quickinstall.sh)
```shell
# Instead of running the script, It is better to open it and follow the instructions
. scripts/scripts/DSFiwareHackathon-quickinstall.sh
```
