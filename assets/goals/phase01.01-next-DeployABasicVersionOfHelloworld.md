# Phase01: Setup Apisix                                   
## Step01: _Deploy a basic version of a helloWorld chart_

### What can be done once this phase/step has been deployed?
- At this stage you can review the [Deploy a basic version of a helloWorld chart documentation](../docs/README-apisix.md#step01-deploy-a-basic-version-of-a-helloworld-chart) to understand the involved pieces.  
- In case you have access to a PC running Windows, you can access the URL from there. Remember to register the DNS in case you are using local DNSs (`fiwaredsc-consumer.local`), globally accessible DNSs (`fiwaredsc-consumer.ita.es`) should be directly accessible.

## Next steps?
- You can visit the [Deploy a functional version of apisix documentation](../docs/README-apisix.md#step02-deploy-a-functional-version-of-apisix)] to view the actions to deploy the [Apache APISIX](https://apisix.apache.org/) component.
